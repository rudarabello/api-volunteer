## Description

API to front-end app that helps you and your team get organized and achieve your goals

## Motivation

The main motivation for doing this personal project was to see the need for the team of volunteers that I am part of, with difficulties to organize themselves when we have many people on more than one work front. 

### See the examples:

- A volunteer is collaborating in reception and parking on the same day at different times

    * in this case the app can help the volunteer with a reminder

- A volunteer cannot go at the time they had initially made available

    * in this case the app provides a tool to notify the leader

## Features

- `Sign Up` 
- `Sign In` 
- `Add Work Fronts` 
- `Add Schedules` 
- `Accept or Dismiss a invite` 
- `Send a message on unexpected changes `
